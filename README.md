# bugBountyTools
A bunch of scripts for recon use.

# The Idea
I plan on using this to build tools that can be used for doing recon when working on bug bounties or other programs.
I basically just want to try my hand and creating my own versions of established tools so I can learn more about hacking and tool development.
Most likely whatever I build here will have already been built by far more expirienced tool devs but I think having a go at developing my own tools could be a lot of fun and a good learning expierience.
